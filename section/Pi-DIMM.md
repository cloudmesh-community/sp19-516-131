# Pi-DIMM

On Jan 28th 2019, Raspberry Pi released their latest Compute Module: Compute Module 3+ (CM3+).

> This newest version of our flexible board for industrial applications offers over ten times the ARM performance, twice the RAM capacity, and up to eight times the Flash capacity of the original Compute Module. [1]

## Specifications

CM3+ derives from its predecessors Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 (CM3) with improved PCB thermal design and BCM2837B0 processor. Though with a slight increase in its z-height, CM3+ provides better performance in terms of electrical and form-factor.

| Processor | Broadcomm BCM2837B0, Cortex-A53 64-bit Soc @ 1.2GHz |
|:---------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
| RAM       | 1GB LPDDR2                                          |
| Size      | 67.6 x 31.1 x 3.7 mm (2.7 x 1.2 x .14 inches)       |
| Weight    | 9 g (0.02 pounds)                                   |
| Storage   | 0, 8, 16 or 32GB eMMC Storage                       |
| Price     | $25 - $40 U.S.                                     ||

## Thermals

With the improved thermal design and BCM2837B0 processor, CM3+ has a ambient temperature range of -20°C to 70°C. These new features render to lower average temperature and longer sustained operation time before the processor temperature reaches 80°C and starts reducing its clock speed.
